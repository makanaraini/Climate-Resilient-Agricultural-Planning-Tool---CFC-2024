## Project summary [Climate-Resilient Agricultural Planning Tool(C-RAP Tool)]

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Climate change in Eastern Africa is causing extreme weather variability, leading to unpredictable rainfall and extended droughts. Smallholder farmers, who depend heavily on predictable weather for their crops, struggle to adapt to these changes. This results in reduced crop yields, food insecurity, and economic vulnerability.

### How our technology solution can help

Our AI tool provides climate-resilient farming insights for Eastern African farmers. EEE2062rm/16814

### Our idea

The Climate-Resilient Agricultural Planning Tool is designed to support smallholder farmers in Eastern Africa by offering a predictive, AI-driven platform that combines weather data, soil health analysis, and climate models. The tool integrates data from IBM watsonx.ai, The Weather Company APIs, and other environmental intelligence sources to provide personalized, data-driven recommendations.

Farmers can receive insights on the best planting times, water management strategies, and optimal crop choices based on real-time and historical climate data. The tool analyzes localized weather patterns and soil conditions to offer tailored advice, helping farmers mitigate risks associated with climate variability. This increases the chances of successful harvests, ensuring food security and economic stability.

Our platform is an improvement over existing solutions by focusing on region-specific challenges in Eastern Africa and leveraging the power of AI for smarter agricultural planning. It empowers farmers to plan and adapt to climate change more effectively, promoting sustainability and resilience in agriculture.

## Technology implementation

### IBM watsonx product(s) used

**Featured watsonx products**

- [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) - We used watsonx.ai to develop predictive models that analyze weather patterns and soil conditions for Eastern African farms. The AI models recommend optimal planting times, crop choices, and irrigation strategies based on localized climate data. The tool also provides insights on pest risks and crop yield predictions, enhancing decision-making for smallholder farmers.


### Other IBM technology used

**Additional IBM AI services (Remove any that you did not use)**

- [Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) - Watson Machine Learning was used to train and deploy machine learning models that predict crop yields and soil health. The trained models help farmers in Eastern Africa make informed decisions about crop rotation, soil management, and harvest times based on environmental data and historical records.

- [Watson Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio) - Watson Studio was used for collaborative development, data preprocessing, and model training. Our team utilized Watson Studioâ€™s integrated development environment to analyze agricultural datasets and train our machine learning models in a scalable and efficient way.

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

![Project Roadmap](timeline.png)

**Climate-Resilient Agricultural Planning Tool Flow:**

1. **User Interaction with the Platform**: 
   - Users (farmers) access the platform via a mobile app or web portal.
   - They input relevant data, including crop type, location, soil type, and specific farming challenges.

2. **Data Ingestion and Processing**: 
   - The application collects user inputs and integrates external data sources, such as weather forecasts and historical agricultural data.
   - Data is processed using IBM watsonx.ai to analyze the inputs and derive insights.

3. **Model Training and Predictions**:
   - Watson Machine Learning is employed to train models based on the processed data.
   - The system generates predictions regarding optimal planting times, expected crop yields, and soil health metrics.

4. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Based on the predictions, the system provides actionable recommendations for crop selection, irrigation schedules, and soil enhancement techniques to promote climate resilience.

5. **User Queries and Responses**:
   - Users can ask questions through the platform interface.
   - The system processes these inquiries and delivers tailored agricultural advice based on the data-driven recommendations.

6. **Data Storage and Continuous Monitoring**:
   - User data, environmental data, and model predictions are securely stored in the cloud using IBM Object Storage for easy access and future analysis.
   - The system continuously monitors environmental changes, adapting predictions and recommendations based on real-time data updates.
